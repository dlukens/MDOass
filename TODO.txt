- compute CL for Q3D every iter.
- chack area calculation
- minimize variables
- does span include fuselage width?
- compute fuel tank volume right
- recalculate MACs
- Check NaN thing from Q3D and if necessary to set CD =1000
- get rid of copy global or inits eventually
-think about bounds
- rescale airfoil for t/c ratio
- history variables
-check q3d inputs
- remove W_TO from X
